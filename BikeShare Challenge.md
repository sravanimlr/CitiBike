 # Citi Bike Future Success in Des Moines, IA
 This project focused on analyzing Citi Bike data for New York City,NY and then, predicting the success of the same service in Des Moines,IA. 

 ## Selecting the Question
 For this project, the population of both regions were compared along with the McDonalds locations spread for the individual states. Both of these questions were combined in the overall analysis for predicting the success of Citi Bike in Des Moines. Population data was accumulated through Census Data and World Population Review. The McDonalds data was presented in 2 different csv files for each state. 

 ## Tableau Story Point Summaries

 ### New York and Iowa Population Comparison 
 This story point showed a bar graph comparing the total populations of both major cities. It is clear that New York has a significantly large population when compared to Iowa. 

 ### Top Cities in Iowa
 This story point compared top 5 Iowa cities based on population. Here, Des Moines wins the race with a population of 217,891 people. The city data was gathered from World Population Review website. 

### Population Density Distribution 
This story point is an area graph showing the distribution of populations across the top 5 Iowa cities. This is used as a supplement to the previous story to show that Des Moines is still leading here as the top Iowa city. 

### Top Cities in New York with New York Citu
This story point compared top 5 New York cities based on population. New York City is the largest with a popualtion of 8,323,338 people. This data was gathered from World Population Review website. 

### Top Cities in New York without New York City 
The purpose of this story point was to show that other top cities in New York do not have the same large population as New York City. Thus, in this case, New York City can be seen as an outlier due to the large difference. This story point was to highlight the other larger cities and note their populations in comparison to New York City. 

### Comparison of Buffalo,NY and Des Moines,Ia 
This story point compared the populations of Buffalo and Des Moines. Buffalo is the second largest city in New York and both, Des Moines and Buffalo have a similar population between 200,000 and 250,000 people.

### McDonalds Locations in New York 
This story point shows a map of the franchise locations. New York has a narrow spread with sites closer together. 

### McDonalds Locations in Iowa 
This story point shows a map of the franchise locations. Iowa has a wider spread of sites across certain cities. 

## Analysis 

### Population Analysis
After viewing the story points, it is clear that New York City has a large popualtion which played a big role in the success of Citi Bike. Even though Des Moines does not have that large of a population, it can be compared to New York's second largest city, Buffalo. Also, Des Moines is Iowa's largest city, thus it is a major city that can thrive with a bikeshare business despite the popualtion size. 

### Bike Activity Analysis 
Des Moines has a rich variety of bike trails ranging over 500 miles. This information was provided by Iowa Bike Routes website(http://iowabikeroutes.com/trails/des-moines-area-trails/) This is important to consider if the bikeshare stations are set up in relation to the trails, then the service will be successful and promote the trails to be used more frequently. Although Des Moines is not as busy as New York City, it still has natural resources that would promote the use of bikeshare services such as Citi Bike. 

### McDonalds Locations Analysis 
The maps showing Iowa and New York McDonalds locations are a good way to determine the station locations for Des Moines. As the the McDonalds sites are a good way to determine population gathering and density, they can be supplemented with the bike trail start and stop locations to create proper staging areas for bikeshare usage. 

### Overall Analysis 
Des Moines is a good candidate for Citi Bike's next venture for many reasons. Firstly, the city's population is large enough for this business type. Secondly, the city has large bike trails and a total of 500 or more miles worth, which would promote and drive the usage of bikeshare services. Thirdly, it has many locations of McDonalds which is a determining factor of popualtion density; this information can be used to create the city map for bikeshare stations and locations. Lastly, every state has a major city and since Des Moines is Iowa state's largest city, it is clear that this business can be a success there similar to New York City, NY. 

## Future Research 
This is the first step to determine the possible success of Citi Bike in Des Moines,IA. Following this, there is a lot of complex data that needs to be gathered. For example, the longitude and latitude data specifically. This project is the beginning of a larger project which will then carve out the path for the establishment of Citi Bike in Des Moines,IA.
